title: Unable to Import Azure AD Users or Groups
---
It's possible that the Azure AD cache stored in {{ en.DPS }} isn&apos;t properly loaded. Here are the steps to troubleshoot this problem.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
If you just activated the Microsoft Authentication option, it may take a while (about an hour) for the cache to load before being able to import users and user groups.

## Solution

1. On the {{ en.DPS }} Console, go in the ***Companions*** tab and stop the ***Scheduler Service***.

1. In ***Reports - Data Source Logs***, monitor the logs until you get the ***Update Azure cache end*** log entry.

The process may take some time depending on the number of groups and users in Azure AD and their relationship.
{% endsnippet %}

5. Once completed, try to import a user or a group.
6. On success, adapt the refresh rate in ***Administration - Server Settings - Authentication - Microsoft Authentication - Microsoft Authentication Users and User Groups Cache*** to allow enough time to completely refresh the AAD cache.
