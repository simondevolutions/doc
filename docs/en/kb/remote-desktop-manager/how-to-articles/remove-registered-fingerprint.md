title: Remove a Registered Fingerprint
---
It is possible in {{ en.RDM }} to remove a previously trusted fingerprint for a host.

This information is saved in a file called ***known_host***

It is located by default at the installation of {{ en.RDM }} here: %LocalAppData%\Devolutions\RemoteDesktopManager

If you are not installed in the default path, it will be located in the same folder as your {{ en.RDM }} executable file.
