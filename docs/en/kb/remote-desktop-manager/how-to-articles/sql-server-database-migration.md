title: SQL Server Database Migration Best Practice
---
To migrate the content of your SQL Server database from on premise to cloud or visa versa or any other combination thereof. We suggest you follow the recommended best practice detailed below.  

Two tools are available, you can choose between the <a href="#dma">Data Migration Assistant</a> (DMA) from Microsoft or the <a href="#ssms">Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</a> (SSMS).  

### Setup
We strongly suggest you clean up your database prior to the move.

12. Validate if you have issues by scrolling down the schema objects list on the left. You can click on an item for more details on the specific issue and if a fix is available.  
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
The users account with the error Windows users can be converted to external users in Azure SQL Database needs to be deselected from the list for the migration to work.  

Those specific users will need to [export](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/export-import-entries/) their ***User vault*** and configuration prior to the migration Failing to do so will loose the data saved under those sections: ***My account settings*** , ***User specific settings*** and any entry made in their ***User vault***  

After exporting the user data, you will need to create a new user in your list and reimport the data.
{% endsnippet %}  

13. When all the issues are fixed or deselected, click ***Generate SQL script***  
![KB4731.png](/img/en/kb/KB4731.png)
