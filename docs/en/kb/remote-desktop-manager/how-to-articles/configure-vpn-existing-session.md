# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
Follow this procedure to configure in {{ en.RDM }} a VPN entry with an existing session.  

In this example we are launching a ***Website*** session entry first then the RDP.  

For this you will need to configure a VPN inside the RDP session and this VPN will launch the ***Website*** session entry.  

### Method
You will need to first create a ***Website*** session entry with the URL and then do the following:
1. Go in the ***Properties*** of your second RDP entry, under ***VPN/SSH/Gateway***
1. Set ***Open*** to ***Always connect***
1. Set ***Type*** to ***Session***

Once this is done, use the RDM Jump feature to launch your second RDP entry which will first open the ***Website*** session entry you have configured as a VPN to establish the connection.
