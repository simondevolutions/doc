The following bullet list describe each steps a support technician will follow to assist a customer to upgrade the {{ en.DPS }} instance.

1. Ensure that the Domain functional level is at least at version Windows Server 2012R2.
1. Confirm for database and web application folder backups. Ensure that the Copy only backup option is enabled in SQL Server Management Studio to get a stand alone backup that is not part from a backup set.

1. For version older than 2020.1.x, check if a Passphrase Security Provider is set on the {{ en.DPS }} instance. If so, remove the security provider before the upgrade and then set the new Encryption at REST after the upgrade. A database backup following each steps will avoid going back at the beginning of the process if something wrong happens.
1. Confirm for 2FA settings.
1. Confirm for Integrated Security enabled or disabled in Database tab.
   1. If so, confirm that the connected user on the Windows machine has enough permissions to do database upgrades. To be sure, look in the Application pool identity.
