title: The Encryption File is Missing
---
After the creation of a {{ en.DPS }} instance, when trying to open the web page, the following error is displayed in the browser.

## Solution

This issue normally happens when the Integrated Security option is set in the Database tab of the {{ en.DPS }} settings.

To solve the issue, the service account of the {{ en.DPS }} IIS Application Pool and the service account of the DevolutionsSchedulerService in the services need Read permission on the encryption.config file that is located in the App_Data subfolder of the {{ en.DPS }} web application folder.

To navigate to the web application folder, you can use the Explore content of website directory button from the {{ en.DPS }} Console.
