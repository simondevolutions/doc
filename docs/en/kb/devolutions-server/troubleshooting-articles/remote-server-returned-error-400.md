## Solution

There are two different solutions for this issue.

1. Reduce the number of AD Groups that the user account is part of. We are aware that most of the time, because of the design of the AD structure, it is not possible to reduce the number of AD groups.
2. Increase the settings for the ***MaxFieldLength*** and the ***MaxRequestBytes*** registry entries on the server. Please consult the following Microsoft article for more information on how to increase these values.
