  title: List of Internet Endpoints that are Accessed by {{ en.DPS }}
---
This is the list of addresses that are accessed by {{ en.DPS }} during normal operation, as well as the setting(s) to disable/prevent this access.

{% snippet icon.badgeWarning %}
We use a "best effort" approach to maintain this list, but it does NOT replace proper IT Security practices. If security is paramount, it would be better to first block all internet access, then white-list desired addresses as needed.
