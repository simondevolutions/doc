  title: RDM {{ en.MAC }} Custom Installer
---
Unfortunately, there is no custom installer in the {{ en.RDM }} macOS version as we do have for the [Windows RDM application](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/installation_custominstallerservice.html).

The solution would be to copy the .cfg file and manually distribute it to the right folder.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
This data source configuration includes the username and password of the desktop you are copying from.

## The .cfg file location in macos

1. Open ***Finder***.
1. Click ***Go*** in the menu.
1. Select ***Go to folder***.
1. Paste this path: ~/Library/Application Support
1. Open the folder: com.devolutions.remotedesktopmanager
1. Locate the RemoteDesktopManager.cfg or RemoteDesktopManagerFree.cfg file.
