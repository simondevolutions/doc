title: Move DVLS Web Site at Default Web Site Root
---
The following guide explains how to move the {{ en.DPS }} web application on the root and set it as a web site. We recommend to first have a working {{ en.DPS }} instance according to this guide for [Creating {{ en.DPS }} Instance](https://helpserver.devolutions.net/install_createrdmsinstance.html) We highly recommend to backup your current working installation before modifying any parameters in IIS Manager.
