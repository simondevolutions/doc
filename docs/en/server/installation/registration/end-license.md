Some of our {{ en.DPS }} users could wonder, what will happen with their data when the license expires.  

### Subscription 
All {{ en.DPS }} subscription plans offer software maintenance for the duration of the subscription time, which includes all major/minor upgrades and technical support.  

You need to renew your subscription agreement upon expiry. If you don’t renew your subscription, access to your data will be limited to view only.  

That being said, you will be able to export your data if you choose to migrate to another type of data source than {{ en.DPS }} .
