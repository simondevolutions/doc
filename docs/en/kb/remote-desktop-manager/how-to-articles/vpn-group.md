{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
VPN groups are defined inside each individual entry in the VPN/SSH/Gateway section.
{% endsnippet %}  

When multiple entries are configured to use the same VPN group, the VPN connection will stay active until the last session disconnects.

The VPN close mode needs to be set to ***On sessions close*** to use this feature.  

The VPN group name needs to be exactly the same to ensure that {{ en.RDM }} increments the usage counter.
