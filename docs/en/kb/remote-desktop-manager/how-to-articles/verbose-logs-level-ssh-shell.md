title: Verbose Logs Level in SSH Shell
---
When an issue with an SSH Shell session arises, support might require that you sent them a ***Verbose log*** Different verbose level exists:  

Level 1: Information about the traces of the connection.  

Level 2: Information about the traces of the connection & Deeper   debug.  

Level 3: Information about the traces of the connection & Deeper debug & Debug of common error messages.

Level 4: Information about the traces of the connection & Deeper debug & Debug of common error messages & Verbose for every packet transmitted.

In general we will require a ***Verbose log*** set to level 2.
