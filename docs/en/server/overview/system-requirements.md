## Minimum Requirements 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
{{ en.RDMS }} needs Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 to function. Please adapt your environment depending on which version you are running. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
{{ en.RDMS }} now verifies that the domain and forest functional levels are at least Windows Server 2012R2. This is essential when using Active Directory authentication. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
## Dependencies 
* Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2014/2016/[2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql-server/sql-server-2017-editions)/[2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019)/[2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022) (including Express editions). 
* Azure SQL database is supported with SQL login accounts only. Azure Active Directory accounts are not supported. 
* Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2012R2, 2016, 2019 and 2022. 
* Windows Server 2012R2 domain and forest functional level or higher. 
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 (Please refer to the [requirements for the .Net Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8z6watww%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) for operating systems). 
* Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 or better. 
* {{ en.RDMSCONSOLE }} must be installed on the server to manage the {{ en.RDMS }} instance(s). 

## Server sizing 
Many customers often ask how to properly customize their servers for various topologies. This is essentially unreliable because the way the system is used has a significant impact on the resource usage of each node within the chosen [Topology](/server/overview/topologies/) .  

The great majority of setups that we have observed work well with nodes of 8GB RAM and a dual CPU. Most of these are virtualized environments, so granting more resources is relatively simple.  

For a proper estimate, the following aspects must be considered:  

* Number of entries stored in your instance (server details, credentials, etc.).  
* Churn of these entries; do you create entries daily or are they quite static?  
* Number of concurrent users that connect to the {{ en.RDMS }} instance during peak times.  
* Usage of information by the users. Are they launching 10 sessions at a time, doing a batch operation that takes a few minutes and then repeating the cycle, or are they opening only a few sessions but working within them all day long. This results in write operations to our logs, therefore the former case is more intensive then the latter.  

## 64-bit Support 
{{ en.RDMS }} is compatible with all 64-bit versions of Windows.
