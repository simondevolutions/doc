# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
To be able to connect to a SQL database with {{ en.DPS }} , here is the suggested configuration in Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition.
## Steps
Most of our customers use the mixed mode Server Authentication As per Microsoft, it is not the safest authentication method to use with Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition but we recommend to use it to configure and test your {{ en.DPS }} instance. After a successful installation of {{ en.DPS }} , you can set it back to Windows Authentication mode and set the Integrated Security option in the ***Database*** tab of the {{ en.DPS }} &#32; Server Settings Consult this topic on [How to Configure {{ en.DPS }} to use integrated security](/kb/devolutions-server/how-to-articles/configure-server-use-integrated-security/) To enable the mixed mode, in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio , open the properties dialog of your server and go in the ***Security*** tab. Then, select the SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode option.

The next option that needs to be activated is the ***Allow remote connections to this server*** option. You will find that option in the ***Connections*** tab of the SQL Server ***Properties*** dialog. Then, click on the ***OK*** button to save the modifications.

Finally, the SQL Server Browser service must be started on the machine where the SQL Server is hosted. Please run servicesmsc and look for the SQL Server Browser in the list.

We recommend to set the Startup type to Automatic for the SQL Server Browser service. Double-click on the service to open the ***Properties*** dialog. Then start the service by clicking on the ***Start*** button and select ***Automatic*** in the Startup type drop down menu. Finally, click on the ***OK*** button.
