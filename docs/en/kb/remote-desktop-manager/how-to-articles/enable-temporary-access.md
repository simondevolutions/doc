title: Enable Temporary Access
---
With the ***Temporary Access*** feature, you can provide a designated user with temporary access to an entry during a designated time frame. This is much more secure than changing the user’s access rightsà and then changing them back once the task is done.

These settings are only available for the {{ en.DPS }}, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Azure SQL advanced data sources.
