## Exceptions for web browsers

### Windows

Firefox does not trust the same certificates as Windows and a setting must be applied in order to enable this.

Please consult [Mozilla's KB](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox)

### Linux

Both Firefox and Chrome use their own certificate trust stores.

Please consult the same [Mozilla KB](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox)
