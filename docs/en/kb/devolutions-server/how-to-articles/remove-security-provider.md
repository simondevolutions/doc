The Security Provider was implemented in older {{ en.DPS }} versions and is no longer considered as secure per the explanation at the beginning of this blog article [Update on Devolutions Password Server Security Provider Deprecation](https://blog.devolutions.net/2020/02/update-on-devolutions-password-server-security-provider-deprecation).

The following procedure explains how to remove the Security Provider and implement the Encryption at REST using the encryption keys.

## Steps

1. Ensure no users are connected to the {{ en.DPS }} data source or the {{ en.DPS }} web interface. It is possible to verify and disconnect all users in Reports - Connected User List on the {{ en.DPS }} web interface.
1. Switch the {{ en.DPS }} instance to offline with the ***Go Offline*** button on the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }}

1. If the Scheduler is installed, please uninstall it from the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} in the Companions tab. Please note that if a service account is configured to run the Scheduler service, ensure to have the service account&apos;s password to reinstall it at the end of the procedure.

1. Backup the {{ en.DPS }} web application folder. Or if possible, take a snapshot of the virtual machine were {{ en.DPS }} is hosted.
1. Make a full database backup.
1. Go in ***Tools*** menu of the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} and click on ***Remove Security Provider*** button.

1. Switch the {{ en.DPS }} instance to online mode using the Go Online button.

1. Once completed, verify that the data is available like the entries&apos; configuration, passwords, etc. Verify the documents or attachments that exist in the database.

If {{ en.DPS }} is installed in a Load Balancing/High Availability topology, only remove the Security Provider on one node. Then refresh the other nodes to notice that the Security Provider has been removed.
{% endsnippet %}  

9. On success, switch the instance to offline mode, make another database backup and a snapshot of the virtual machine were {{ en.DPS }} is hosted. If for any reason, any of the next steps fails, a backup will be available to get back at this step instead of starting back to the beginning.

If the Activate Encryption at Rest button is not visible in the Tools menu, please jump to step 13.
{% endsnippet %}  

10. Again, go in the Tools menu of the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} and click on the Activate Encryption At Rest button. This step is to properly encrypt the data in the SQL database.

11. Once completed, export the Encryption Keys. Ensure to save that file and the password in a secure place for being able to build another {{ en.DPS }} instance connected to the same SQL database. Without those encryption keys, it is impossible to access to the data.
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
We recommend to not store the encryption keys file and its password in your {{ en.DPS }} instance
{% endsnippet %}

1. Once completed, verify again if the entries, the documents and the attachments are available.  
1. If the Scheduler service has been uninstalled on step 3, install it back from the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} in the Companions tab.  
![Install the Scheduler.png](/img/en/kb/kb8084.png)
1. On success, one last database backup and virtual machine snapshot can be done.

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
If {{ en.DPS }} is installed in a Load Balancing/High Availability topology, refresh the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} and import the Encryption Keys to ensure to use the same on every node.
