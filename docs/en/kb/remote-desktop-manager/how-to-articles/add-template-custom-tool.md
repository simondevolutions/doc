# {{ en.TOPICTITLE }}
Get access to a one-click ***Custom Tool*** which would apply a ***Template*** automatically to one of your connections in {{ en.RDM }} The main goal of this solution is to save you a few clicks since launching an entry with a ***Template*** would require that you follow all these steps:  

1. Select one of your entries.
1. Right-click on it.
1. Select ***Open with Parameters***
1. Select ***Open with a Template***
1. Choose the ***Template*** you wish to use in the list.  

The method below, will give you a quick access in RDM’s Dashboard ***Macros/Scripts/Tools*** section of the entry. It will allow you to click on the ***Custom Tool*** and open the connection that currently has focus with the parameters specified in your ***Templates***

The ***Template*** that you will create (Database template only) will need to have the option ***Available in Macros/Scripts/Tools*** enabled in the ***Template Settings – Availability*** section in order for it to be shown in your ***Dashboard***
