{% youtube 'aoFVQ6X53nI' %}

By default, open session tabs in {{ en.RDM }} can be viewed and scrolled on a single line with arrows. To view the whole list you must press the down arrow.  

The multi-row view can be enabled in ***File - Options - User interface*** with unchecking the ***Use tab strip overflow (disable multiline tab pages)*** feature.
