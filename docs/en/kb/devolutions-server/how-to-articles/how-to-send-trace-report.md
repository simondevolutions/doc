Follow these steps to send a trace report to the Devolutions support team for the {{ en.DPS }} web interface.

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %}
Keep in mind that HAR files contain sensitive data, including content of the pages you downloaded while recording and your cookies. This allows anyone with the HAR file to impersonate your account and all the information that you submitted while recording (personal details, passwords, credit card numbers, etc.).
