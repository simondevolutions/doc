```
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Devolutions\Remote Desktop Manager\RemoteDesktopManager.PowerShellModule.psd1'

$ds = Get-RDMDataSource -Name "NameOfYourDataSourceHere"
Set-RDMCurrentDataSource $ds

# Update the password
$passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force "YourPasswordHere"

$repos = Get-RDMRepository

foreach ($repo in $repos)
{
  Set-RDMCurrentRepository $repo
  Update-RDMUI

  $sessions = Get-RDMSession
  $reponame = $repo.name

  # Adapt the destination path for the .rdm files
  Export-RDMSession -Path "C:\temp\$reponame.rdm" -Sessions $sessions -IncludeCredentials -XML -Password $passwd
}
