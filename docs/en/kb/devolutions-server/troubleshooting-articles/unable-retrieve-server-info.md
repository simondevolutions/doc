## Solution

The accounts used to interact with the SQL database are missing privileges. You will have to either grant ownership permissions to those accounts or grant least privileges. In the latter, please contact us and we will provide the right SQL statement according to the {{ en.DPS }} version you are using.

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
As every {{ en.DPS }} version has different database schema, we prefer not publishing at wide all different SQL statements to avoid unwanted behaviours and issues.
