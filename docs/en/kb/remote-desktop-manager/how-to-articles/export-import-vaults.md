1. Go to ***Administration - Export All Vaults (.rdx)***
1. Select the vaults from the prompted list and click ***OK***
1. For a typical migration, you would check the options ***Include credentials, Include attachments and documents*** and ***Encrypt with master key***

By default the credentials are NOT included. It&apos;s critical to check the ***Include credentials*** option in order for the exported data to include the credentials.

Specifying a master key will encrypt the whole content of the ***.rdx*** file to protect its content. It is highly recommended as a backup measure, but the key is absolutely necessary for decryption. Preserve this as well in a separate storage device for safekeeping.
