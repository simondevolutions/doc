{{ en.RDMS }} is an on‑premise vault for storing and sharing information across your whole organization. Manage remote connections, credentials, and sensitive information with ease.  

Use our ***User Groups Based Access Control*** to grant permissions in a granular fashion. Advanced logging of all user activity is included to offer visibility in all aspects of the solution.  

Because of its Web Architecture you have the possibility to offer it only from your intranet or publish it on the Internet.

There are two ways of using {{ en.RDMS }} : 

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>

![clip10056.png](/img/en/server/clip10056.png)  

## Web-Based Vault  

Web browser access and [{{ en.DWL }}](/server/dwl/overview/) 
		</td>
		<td>
![Application64x64.png](/img/common/Application64x64.png)  

## Session Management  

Using a client application (desktop or mobile) 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Access vaulted resources from a web browser using a Client Access License (CAL). Credentials are managed directly from the web interface and no client application is required.  

With the {{ en.DWL }} browser extension, credentials can be automatically submitted when connecting to a website. 
		</td>
		<td>
Access vaulted resources using our client applications which communicate with {{ en.RDMS }} web services. A local installation of a client application such as {{ en.RDM }} is required to manage the data source and its resources. Note that we offer Windows, macOS, Android and iOS editions.  

Use any type of entry, manage all aspects of the data source and monitor user activity all in the same application. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Remote access technologies (RDP, VNC, etc.) are not supported within a web browser. 
		</td>
		<td>
Unlike with web browser access, {{ en.RDM }} can launch sessions using remote access technologies. 
		</td>
	</tr>
