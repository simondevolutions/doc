## CVSS

The CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability management processes.

For more details and a description of the various equation components, please visit the [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/) website.

## CVE
![KB4756.png](/img/en/kb/KB4756.png)

The CVE mission program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. There is one CVE Record for each vulnerability in the catalog. The vulnerabilities are discovered then assigned and published by organizations from around the world that have partnered with the CVE Program. Partners publish CVE Records to communicate consistent descriptions of vulnerabilities. Information technology and cybersecurity professionals use CVE Records to ensure they are discussing the same issue and to coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address the vulnerabilities. It is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, it is a security flaw that has been assigned a CVE ID number.
