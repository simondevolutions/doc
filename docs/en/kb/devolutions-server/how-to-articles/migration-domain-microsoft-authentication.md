title: Migration from Domain Authentication to Microsoft Authentication
---
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
We strongly recommend to be careful with this migration as it affects all user accounts authentication method. To avoid any problems, our recommendation would be to test it in a staging environment.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
Before deploying this migration in your production environment, we recommend to have a working backup of the SQL database and the Encryption Keys if you need to restore your {{ en.DPS }} instance.

It is possible to efficiently migrate {{ en.DPS }} Domain authentication to Microsoft authentication using the following steps. Some sections require to run PowerShell scripts or SQL statements. As those scripts may change according to the {{ en.DPS }} version, please check our [GitHub RDMSamples-ps](https://github.com/Devolutions/RDMSamples-ps) repository to get them.
### Preparation phase
* Ask all users to export their User Vaults (formerly know as Private Vault) for safety measure.
* Have all AAD security groups created in Azure.  

  * Make sure to not use commas as part of the AAD security group name.
* Have Azure Apps created for {{ en.DPS }}.
[Configure Microsoft authentication](/kb/devolutions-server/how-to-articles/azure-portal-configuration-guide-microsoft-authentication/) in {{ en.DPS }}.
* Enable [Offline Mode](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/datasource_offline.html) feature for the transition period (optional).  

  * Test Offline Mode feature few days before migration.
* Temporary disable the [Domain Automatic user creation](https://helpserver.devolutions.net/authentication_domain.html#automatic-user-creation)
* Prepare a new {{ en.RDM }} data source that contains the new authentication method and [export the data source](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/datasource_importexport.html) it in ardd file.  

  * Add the .rdd file in the main vault and ask all users to open it in {{ en.RDM }} to be automatically added in their data sources list.
### Migration phase option 1 (keeping the actual SQL database)
* Backup the SQL database.
* If migrating {{ en.DPS }} and/or SQL on a new server.  

  * Export Encryption Keys from the old {{ en.DPS }} instance.
  * Restore the SQL database on the new server.  
  * [Create the new {{ en.DPS }} instance](https://helpserver.devolutions.net/install_createrdmsinstance.html) and connect it on the existing or newly restored SQL database using the exported Encryption Keys.
* Migrate all existing user accounts to Microsoft authentication UPN username format.  

  * We provide an SQL statement for this migration step. Please send an email to [service@devolutions.net](mailto:service@devolutions.net) to get it.
* Migrate User groups (formerly known as Roles) to the new AAD security groups names.  

  * We provide a PowerShell script to update all permissions to use all newly named User groups. You can download the [script here](https://github.com/Devolutions/RDMSamples-ps/blob/main/module/security/SetPermissionsonFoldersInVault.ps1)
  * Manually update vaults access permissions to use the newly named User groups.
### Migration phase option 2 (start with a fresh installation)
* Export all entries per vault from the actual {{ en.DPS }} instance.  

  * We provide a PowerShell script to export the entries per vault in a folder (password protectedRDM files). You can download the [script here](https://github.com/Devolutions/RDMSamples-ps/blob/main/module/export/ExportAllEntriesAllVaults.ps1)
* Export all documents and attachments saved in the database from the actual {{ en.DPS }} instance.  

  * We provide a PowerShell script to export files in a folder. You can download the [script here](https://github.com/Devolutions/RDMSamples-ps/blob/main/module/export/ExportDocumentsDatabase.ps1)
* Export [Templates](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/file_templates.html) and [Password Templates](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/file_template_passwordtemplates.html) from the actual {{ en.DPS }} instance.
[Create the new {{ en.DPS }} instance][def]
* Import user accounts from Azure.
* Import groups from Azure.
* Create vaults and import their respective entries.
* Manually import documents and attachments.
* Manually import Templates and Password Templates.
* Set permissions on vaults, folders, entries.  

  * We can provide a PowerShell script to set permissions from a CSV file.
### Post-migration phase
* [Reset the {{ en.DPS }} cache](https://helpserver.devolutions.net/webinterface_resetcache.html) to update users, user groups, vaults and entries.
* Verify Microsoft authentication in {{ en.RDM }} and/or web UI.
* Verify RBAC functionality and verify if permissions are properly set.
* Verify User Vault entries.  

  * For a fresh installation, migration option 2, ask users to import their entries back in their own User Vault.
* On success, for migration option 1, disable the Domain authentication feature.
