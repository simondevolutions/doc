  title: Batch Edit in {{ en.RDM }}
---
In {{ en.RDM }} , you can edit the properties of multiple entries or folders at once using the ***[Batch Edit](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/commands_batchedit.html)*** or ***Edit (Special Actions)*** features.

## Entry/Folder Selection 

Entries and folders to be edited can be selected using the methods below. Choose the one that best suits your needs.

{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %}
Best practice suggests using the ***[Advanced Search](#advanced)*** or ***[Multi Vault Search](#multi)*** methods, as selecting them manually in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** is more time consuming and carries the risk of forgetting some entries/folders. This last method can only be recommended if you have only a few selected entries to edit.

Regardless of the method used, it is recommended that only one entry type be selected for each batch edit action.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
To edit the information of folders, you MUST go through the ***[Advanced Search](#advanced)*** or ***[Multi Vault Search](#multi)*** methods to select the folders. If you select the folders manually in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}***, you will be editing the information in the child entries of the folders, NOT the information in the folders themselves.

### Manual selection 
<a name="manual"></a>

In {{ en.RDM }}, select all entries/folders manually in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}***. Use **Ctrl+Left-Click** to select them one by one or **Shift+Left-Click** to select a bunch of them at the same time. Note that by selecting a folder, you are editing the information of its child entries and not the information of the folder.

Proceed to the [Batch Edit Actions](#edit) section for the next steps or continue to read about the other selection methods.

### Advanced Search

The ***[Advanced Search](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/advanced_search.html)*** feature allows you to search the currently selected vault.
