title: Add an RDP Entry
---
***RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop)*** and other tools that open remote connections are saved as ***Session*** entries {{ en.RDM }}. The entries store information about the host, credentials, local resources, and VPN, so users can open a session with one click. You can also set permissions, configure security settings and customize logs.  

Here are the basics to get you started.  

1. On the ***Edit*** tab, click ***New Entry***
1. Choose ***RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop)***
1. Enter a n ame for the session.
1. Choose a ***Display*** mode, the most common are:
    * ***Embedded*** (tabbed) opens a new tab in {{ en.RDM }}.
    * ***External*** opens in the external application.
1. Choose the credentials to use.  

    To use credentials you have saved as a separate entry, choose ***Credential repository*** and select the entry from the list.  

    Select ***Default*** if you want to enter the credentials directly in the entry.  

6. Enter the ***Host*** address.
### Open a RDP session
Click ***Open Session*** on the ***Home*** ***tab or*** ***Dashboard***  

You can open more than one session at once. With embedded sessions you can switch between the tabs or monitor connections simultaneously: use thumbnail view or [rearrange open sessions with split screen](https://help.remotedesktopmanager.com/view_embeddedsessions.html)
